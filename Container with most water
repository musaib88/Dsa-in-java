You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int min=0;
        int max=0;
        int a;int b;
        int i=0;int j=height.length-1;
        while(i<j){
         a=Math.min(height[i],height[j]);
         b=j-i;
         min=a*b;
         if(min>max){
         max=min;
        }
         if(height[i]<height[j]){
             i++;
         }
         else {
             j--;
         }
         
      }
      return max;
